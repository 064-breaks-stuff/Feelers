Feelers is a project I'm developing to serve as a "Song vibe-matching" application. 

Feelers came about after repeated poor experiences with Spotify's shuffle feature, where there the connection between two subsequent songs seemed minimal or even non-existent in some instances. 

As a solution, I decided to develop an objective vectorized system that breaks each song down to raw numbers, which can then be compared to generate queues of songs that have similar "vibes".
